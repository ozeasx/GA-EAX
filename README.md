# GA-EAX
A genetic algorithm using Edge Assembly Crossover for the traveling salesman problem.

This repository contains the C++ code for the following paper: <br>
Yuichi Nagata and Shigenobu Kobayashi, A Powerful Genetic Algorithm Using Edge Assembly Crossover for the Traveling Salesman Problem, INFORMS Journal on Computing, Vol. 25, No. 2, pp. 346â€“363 (2013) [[link]](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.1120.0506)

This GA is known as one of the most powerful heuristic algorithms for the traveling salesman problem, and this code was originally published on the journal site as a supplementary material for this paper. However, it is no longer available on the journal site, and I have made this code available on this site.
